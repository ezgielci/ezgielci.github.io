I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of International Relations at Özyeğin University. I earned my Ph.D. from Koç University, Turkey. Previously, I held a Fulbright-funded position as a visiting researcher at the University of Georgia. I am honored to be a recipient of the Science Academy's 2025 Young Scientist Award. My research focuses on political behavior and political communication, with publications in journals such as the British Journal of Political Science, Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, American Behavioral Scientist, European Political Science Review, and several edited volumes.
