I am an assistant professor in the Department of International Relations at Özyeğin University. I obtained my Ph.D. from Koç University, Turkey. Previously, I was a visiting researcher at the University of Georgia with a Fulbright grant. I am a recipient of Science Academy's Young Scientist Award 2025. My research interests include political behavior and political communication. My work has been published in the British Journal of Political Science, Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, American Behavioral Scientist, European Political Science Review, and edited volumes.
