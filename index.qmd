:::{#me}


I am an assistant professor in the Department of International Relations at Özyeğin University. I obtained my Ph.D. in the Department of Political Science and International Relations at Koç University. Previously, I was a visiting student researcher at the Center for the Study of Global Issues (GLOBIS) at the University of Georgia with a Fulbright grant. My research interests are political behavior and political communication. More specifically, my research focuses on populism, democratization, migrants, and minorities in Turkey.
